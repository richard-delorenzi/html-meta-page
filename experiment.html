	    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
	    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
	    All mimsy were the borogoves,
	    And the mome raths outgrabe.
	  </a>
	  <a name="stansa2" class="hideable">
	    “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
	    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
	    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
	    The frumious Bandersnatch!;”

	    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
	    Long time the manxome foe he sought --
	    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
	    And stood awhile in thought.
	  </a>
	  <a name="stansa4" class="hideable">
	    And, as in uffish thought he stood,
	    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
	    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
	    And burbled as it came!
	  </a>
	  <a name="stansa5" class="hideable">
	    One, two! One, two! And through and through
	    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
	    He left it dead, and with its head
	    He went galumphing back.
	  </a>
	  <a name="stansa6" class="hideable">
	    “And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
	    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
	    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
	    He chortled in his joy.
	  </a>
	  <a name="stansa7" class="hideable">
	    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
	    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
